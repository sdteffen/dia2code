TO DO

Documentation:
- Add good (real life) examples to the docs and the web page.
- Do a manual for Dia2Code.

Core:
- Virtual inheritance (C++)
- A framework to allow custom code generator modules to be
  easily made by third parties.
- Restructure the code, some parts really suck

Code generators:
- Default return value for non-void methods.
- Custom extension for C++ files: .c++, .C, etc.
- Custom visibility for Java classes: by default, all are
  public now.
- Code generation for more languages, see
  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=15307&atid=365307

Compilation, Installation and Distribution
- Modify autoconf/automake files to install dia2code.1 and dia2code.kaptn
  into appropiate directories.
- Install dia2code.h into /usr/local/include/dia2code or appropriate
  directory structure
- Add modules to the regular build process
- Make modules install into /usr/local/lib or something appropriate
  to allow all users to access the files

Extra:
- A nice improvement would be generating a classlist from existing code.
  For this task we need parsers for the supported languages.
